2.  The Hash table is incredibly faster as larger amounts of items are added,
    compared to the tree. However, it is more prone to a very "jerky"
    behavor as random spikes can occur in run time. The tree is overall much
    worse to use regardless as it linearly increases in time at a fast pace.
    One thing that would be good to look at is overall memory usage and speed in
    situations, such as needed to increase copacity.
